LCD driver chip is ST7565R, which has Arduino libraries. 
Connection is through CS, RSE, RS, SCL, SI, VDD, GND. 
The white backlight LEDs connect to A (+3.3V) and K (ground), draw about 80mA at 3.3V. 
The four IC_xx pins connect to a 20L16S1Y, a character ROM for Chinese characters and can be left unconnected. 

library u8g2 / U8G2_ST7565_ERC12864_F_4W_HW_SPI and set contrast to 20

U8G2_ST7565_64128N_1_4W_HW_SPI and U8X8_ST7565_64128N_4W_HW_SPI. 
For contrast setting use 191 (setContrast(191)).
